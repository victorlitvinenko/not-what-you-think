# Travel-app on React
### Deploy: https://victorlitvinenko-travel-app.netlify.app/
Single page application that shows much information about different countries in 3 languages. The number of countries can be unlimited because it renders content based on the data from JSON (but API may be used instead). Content language, selected country, and search are working without page reload. Also was implemented correct routing which allows to use of direct URL and go backward and forward on the APP URL history.
